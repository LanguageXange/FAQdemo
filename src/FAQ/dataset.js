    question: "What is Amazon.ca?",
    answer:
      "Amazon.ca is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, a leading online retailer of products that inform, educate, and inspire. The Amazon group also has stores in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. Because we exist virtually on the Web, we have unlimited shelf space and can offer a selection of over 10 million titles including over 7 million book titles and over 700,000 music titles. Compare that to a typical physical-world book superstore, which carries around 170,000 books, or a typical physical-world music superstore, which carries around 34,000 CDs.",

    question: "Why do I encounter various availability listings on your site?",
    answer:
      "Titles have different availabilities simply due to their demand, proximity, and availability to Amazon.ca. We also source our products from various distributors. The availability on products we obtain from distributors may vary according to whether the distributor has the product in stock or not. If a title is listed as out of stock or unavailable, it means that it is not currently available to Amazon.ca or not in stock through our distribution channels. However, you may still be able to sell out of stock items through our Marketplace feature.",

    question: "What does the sales rank mean?",
    answer:
      "Our sales rank is just like a bestseller list, except instead of listing just the top 50 or so titles, it includes millions! The lower the number, the higher the popularity for that particular title in comparison to other items listed. Items are ranked within their product category only, so a book, CD or DVD ranked at Number 1 is the best-selling book, CD or DVD at Amazon.ca, but may not be the overall best-selling item.Sales rank data is calculated hourly. While we cannot provide specific information about our calculation formula, Amazon.ca Marketplace sales are also included in the calculation. Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for vendors - we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources.",

      "How do I remove an old or out-of-print listing from the Amazon.ca catalogue?",
    answer: `As you may know, we offer customers the opportunity to locate out-of-print books and other products no longer available through our Marketplace feature. 
      It is our aim to list a wide selection of titles for our customers' reference and convenience, 
      so it is not our practice to remove a listing even when it is out of print.If the case is such that a new edition is replacing the edition we list in our store, you'll need to help us get the new version online.

    question: "Why are some titles discounted while others are not?",
    answer:
      "Our decision to discount products is made internally and based on a number of strategic considerations which can vary over time. As it stands now, we offer discounts on hundreds of thousands of selected titles. However we cannot confirm when, if ever, a title will be discounted or how long a title once discounted will remain so.",
